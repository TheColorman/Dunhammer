**Levelsystem**
The levelsystem is one of the main uses of Dunhammer.
You gain xp in a server by being active in conversations consistently.

There is both a Server-wide leaderboard, and a Global Dunhammer-wide leaderboard. When you level up on the Global leaderboard, you gain Coins <:DunhammerCoin:878740195078463519> that you can spend on various things on the website, such as a new background for your /level command.

If a server has decided to disable the levelsystem, you will still gain xp on the Global leaderboard.

You can opt out of the global leaderboard by going to https://dunhammer.colorman.me/disable.`,

This command sends an anime picture.
The type of picture can be specified with the arguments \`sfw\`, \`nsfw\` or \`nsfw-gif\`, but they won't be explained here (you'll have to experiment for that üòâ)

Clicking the "Report" button will remove the image. This is intended for the rare cases when an image is NSFW despite being in a SFW channel, and other cases where an image might be inappropriate.
The image will then be sent to the Dunhammer creator with some information.
Note: Anyone can report an image. Abuse will lead to a blacklist!`,
